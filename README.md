# focus on this

A stupid simple way to focus on one thing at a time.

**Don't overcomplicate this**, just write in whatever you are working on, leave it up on your phone's screen, then turn off your phone and get to work.  Whenever you turn on your phone to check some distracting news feed this should be the first thing that you see and it reminds you what you are focusing on.
